If you can't access Chrome Web Store, then the second best solution would be to compile the extension yourself if you are on Mac/Linux:

Make sure you have Node.js version 8+ (node -v)
Make sure you can run git from the command line (git --version)
Git clone this repo OR download the latest release at https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/releases
Run npm install or yarn
Run npm run build:extension:chrome, the extension will be compiled to shells/chrome/build/unpacked/
Unfortunately, building the extension on Windows is a bit broken, you can either:

Edit some files to fix it, see #908
Or use this CRX that I have downloaded from the Store, extract the CRX with 7-Zip or another unzipper program, then delete the _metadata folder inside
